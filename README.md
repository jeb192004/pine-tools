# Pine Tools

**This app makes it simple to fix the top row of symbols on the physical keyboard for the Pinephone(pro).**

Currently this only works for **Manjaro-ARM/Phosh**, **Arch/Phosh**, and **Mobian**.  

I would like to add support for more distro/de.

This app is built using electron, nodejs, javascript, html, and css.

I've noticed electronjs v20 there are issues with text not appearing at all in the app.  As of right now I am using Electron v17.0.0.  I'm not seeing any issues as of now.

**Other features:**

·add your own commands that can easily copied for use in the cli
	
·added commands get saved to a JSON file so you can move it to an SD card or back it up where ever you want.  
	
·for git commands, you can just input 'git pull', 'git clone', or 'git push'  then your url and this app will automatically create clone, push, and pull commands for you.  No need for you to write them each out.
